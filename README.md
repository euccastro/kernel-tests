Kernel Tests
============

This aims to be a test suite to check compliance of any given [Kernel](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html) implementation to the current language specification ([Revised<sup>-1</sup> Report on the Kernel Programming Language](ftp://ftp.cs.wpi.edu/pub/techreports/pdf/05-07.pdf), R<sup>-1</sup>RK for short.)

As far as possible, only facilities that can be built from the R<sup>-1</sup>RK in pure Kernel will be used for the tests themselves.

Tests will be organized in several files, to make it straightforward to test different Kernel modules separately.
