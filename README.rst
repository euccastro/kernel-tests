Kernel Tests
============

This aims to be a test suite to check compliance of any given Kernel_ implementation to the *Revised^{-1} Report on the Kernel Programming Language*, R-1RK for short.  (`gzipped postscript`_, pdf_)

As far as possible, only facilities that can be built from the R-1RK in pure Kernel will be used for the tests themselves.

Tests will be organized in several files, to make it straightforward to test different Kernel modules separately.
