Kernel Tests
============

This aims to be a test suite to check compliance of any given Kernel_ implementation to the current language specification [1]_.

As far as possible, only facilities that can be built from the R<sup>-1</sup>RK [1]_ in pure Kernel will be used for the tests themselves.

Tests will be organized in several files, to make it straightforward to test different Kernel modules separately.
